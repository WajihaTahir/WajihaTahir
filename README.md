Hi there 👋
I am Wajiha, currently based in Berlin. Driven by a relentless curiosity for technology, I have immersed myself in learning the latest web development technologies and programming languages. 

Proficient in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript, and experience with frameworks like React and Node.js, I am well-prepared to contribute to the dynamic field of full-stack development.

💬 I speak fluent English and basic German. <br>
🏢 I shall be graduating as a full-stack developer from Code Academy, Berlin in April 2024. <br>
